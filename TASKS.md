# marwandiallo.com — Tasks

Atomic, agent-runnable tasks. Each is small enough to finish + commit in one
session. Pick the top unblocked task, do it, commit, move it to "Done".

**Agent rules**
- Read `PLAN.md` and this file before starting.
- Pick the topmost unchecked task in "Ready". Move it to "In progress" with
  your handle (e.g., `@copilot`).
- Make the change, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`. Fix issues you
  introduce.
- Commit with a short imperative subject. Do not push unless asked.
- Move the task to "Done" with the commit SHA. Update `PLAN.md` if direction
  shifts.

## Blocked

## Done

- **T-01** — Verified sitemap + RSS include all 7 essays (no fix needed; dates match frontmatter). SHA: `7b1d7df`
- **T-02** — OG image colors aligned to cream palette tokens (`#faf7f0` paper, `#0a0a0a` ink, `#33302e` ink-soft, `#6b6661` ink-muted; dropped legacy red accent). Contrast ≥ 5:1 on all text. SHA: `7b1d7df`
- **T-03** — `/writing` index: real hover affordance (row wash + title underline) since `--color-accent` matches `--color-ink` in light mode; bumped row padding and title size for breathing room with lighter palette. SHA: `b490e33`
- **T-04** — Added optional `updated` frontmatter; surfaced `· updated <date>` in essay header when newer than `date`. Sitemap `lastmod` now prefers `updated`. Reading time was already wired. SHA: `d505875`
- **T-05** — Tag pages under `/writing/tag/[tag]` (11 prerendered); added `tagSlug`/`getAllTags`/`getPostsByTag` helpers; tag chips below each summary on `/writing`; tag URLs added to sitemap. SHA: `e7ec227`
- **T-06** — `/projects` route renders all 9 entries in the same FT card grid as the home feed (reuses `.feed-card` + `CardArtwork`); surfaced in nav and sitemap; "All projects →" link on home, "See projects →" link in `/about`. SHA: `5340c66`
- **T-07** — Lighthouse sweep on `/`, `/writing`, `/writing/agent-identity-front`, `/about` (plus `/projects`). Before → after across perf/a11y/seo/bp: home 78/100/91/100 → 99/100/100/100; writing 99/96/91/100 → 98/100/100/100; essay 98/100/91/100 → 98/100/100/100; about 99/100/91/100 → 99/100/100/100. Fixes: split theme bootstrap into its own async server component so root layout stays sync (was making metadata flush after `</head>`), pinned a baseline `<meta name="description">` directly in `<head>` for crawlers, memoized HomeFeed merge/filter, retuned tag chip touch targets (≥28x28 + 12px gap). Projects bp:96 unchanged — tiny font in aria-hidden card art mockups, intentional. SHA: `fc11d93`

## Notes

- Each task is intentionally scoped to ~1 commit. Split if it grows.
- If a task reveals a larger problem, stop, write a new task for it, and
  flag the original as Blocked.
8** — Dark mode audit across every shipped route (`/`, `/writing`, `/writing/[slug]`, `/writing/tag/[tag]`, `/projects`, `/about`, `/now`). Headless puppeteer scan: zero light-background leaks in dark mode (no element wider than 50px renders a high-brightness `background-color` outside the deliberately-light `.feed-card__visual` / `.card-art` blocks). Visual pass clean — page chrome reads ink on `#0a0a0a`, code blocks pick up `--color-bg-elev` `#141414`, segmented-tab indicator uses the dark override (`#000` pill, white text), feed-card hover shadow has dark-mode override, card artwork stays pinned ink on light gradients per the documented decision. Lighthouse a11y in dark mode: `/` 100, `/writing` 100, essay 100, `/about` 100, `/projects` 100. No code changes required — dark token block + per-component overrides already in `app/globals.css` are correct. SHA: `a123149`
